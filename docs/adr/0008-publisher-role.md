# ADR 0008: Director Telemetry Publisher Role

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Engineering issue: https://github.com/simracecenter/simulator-mcp-servers/issues/57

## Context

Director needs to manage the telemetry publisher on a Rig over MCP. The
publisher library is imported from
`margic/director-narrative-core`, branch
`devin/1789000598-local-destination`, PR [#81](https://github.com/margic/director-narrative-core/pull/81),
at source SHA `f88ee0d7bb100fdbd141d19b00049b12ad4dac07`.

## Proposed Decision

`publisher` is a third exclusive launcher role behind the same single
`SwappableHandler`. ADR 0003 D1 is preserved: one role runs per host,
publisher is not a simulator, and it never runs alongside one. The role
handler owns one in-process publisher engine on a dedicated
`publisher-engine` thread.

The ingest URL, certificate fingerprint, and driver display name live in
`[publisher]`. The token is stored in the Windows current-user DPAPI as
`publisher.token` and held only in memory by the engine configuration; it is
never passed through argv, environment variables, logs, status, or debug
output. Stopping requests shutdown, waits up to five seconds for the engine
thread, and reports an unknown state if it does not join in that window.
There is no auto-restart. Switching roles stops the engine.

The mutating tools `publisher_configure`, `publisher_start`, and
`publisher_stop` are gated by ADR 0007's exact-name allowlists, exactly like
camera tools.

## Limits

This slice adds no TLS pairing, installer, autostart, heartbeat, or version
protocol. Wheel controls are out of scope. The default listener is unchanged.
The Director contract is defined by
`simracecenter/director` PR #9,
[`docs/12-rig-pairing.md`](https://github.com/simracecenter/director/blob/main/docs/12-rig-pairing.md).
`POST /pair`, pairing-code validation, and credential minting are not
implemented in this PR.
